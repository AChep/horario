Contributing
============

If you’re looking for ways to contribute, please [peruse open issues](https://github.com/AChep/horario/issues?milestone=&q=is%3Aopen).

Code Style
----------

Horario uses the [code style for Android contributors](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html). The code styles are strict rules, not guidelines or recommendations. Contributions that do not adhere to these rules are generally not accepted.

How to Submit a Pull Request
----------------------------

1. Click the “Fork” button to create your personal fork of the Horario repository.

2. Create a new branch for your new feature. For example: `git checkout -b my-awesome-feature`. A dedicated branch for your pull request means you can develop multiple features at the same time, and ensures that your pull request is stable even if you later decide to develop an unrelated feature.

3. Submit your pull request, and good luck!
